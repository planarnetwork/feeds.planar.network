# GTFS Feeds  

Planar Network maintain a [number of tools](https://www.github.com/planarnetwork) for converting various industry standards to GTFS. Where possible we maintain a public version of the feed itself on [transitfeeds.com](http://transitfeeds.com).

## Rail

Data is supplied and licensed by [Rail Delivery Group](https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/) and is available directly through their [data portal](http://data.atoc.org/).

Download the latest GTFS feed: [gb-rail-latest.zip](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/feeds.planar.network/gb-rail-latest.zip)

## Bus

Coming soon.

## Flights

We have an [open source tool](https://github.com/planarnetwork/ssim2gtfs) to convert SSIM flight schedules to GTFS but no data with a license to public the data in GTFS format. If you would like us to host any feeds please [get in touch](mailto:info@planar.network).
